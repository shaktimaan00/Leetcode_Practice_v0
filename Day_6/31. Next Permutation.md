- **Explain the logic behind the code**:
  The provided code is a C++ implementation of the "Next Permutation" problem, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. If such an arrangement is not possible, it rearranges it as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

  1. **Initialization**:
     - `n` is the size of the input vector `nums`.
     - `k` and `l` are indices used to find the positions to swap.

  2. **Find the first decreasing element**:
     - The code iterates from the end of the vector to find the first element `nums[k]` that is smaller than the element immediately after it (`nums[k+1]`).

  3. **Check if the entire array is non-increasing**:
     - If no such element is found (`k < 0`), the entire array is in non-increasing order, and the function reverses the array to get the smallest permutation.

  4. **Find the element to swap with**:
     - If such an element is found, the code iterates from the end of the vector to find the first element `nums[l]` that is greater than `nums[k]`.

  5. **Swap and reverse**:
     - The elements `nums[k]` and `nums[l]` are swapped.
     - The subarray from `k+1` to the end of the vector is reversed to get the next permutation.

- **Space complexity**:
  The space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(1)\) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

- **Time complexity**:
  The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input vector. This is because the algorithm performs a constant number of operations for each element.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), k, l;

        for (k = n - 2; k >= 0; k--) {
            if (nums[k] < nums[k + 1]) break;
        }

        if (k < 0) {
            reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        } else {
            for (l = n - 1; l >= 0; l--) {
                if (nums[l] > nums[k]) break;
            }
            swap(nums[l], nums[k]);
            reverse(nums.begin() + k + 1, nums.end());
        }
    }
};
