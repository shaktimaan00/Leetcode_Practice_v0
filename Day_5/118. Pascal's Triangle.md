- **Explain the logic behind the code**:
  The provided code is a C++ implementation of generating Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

  1. **Initialization**:
     - `ans` is a vector of vectors that will store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.
     - The first row `{1}` is pushed into `ans`.

  2. **Iteration**:
     - The code uses a `while` loop to generate each row of Pascal's Triangle until `cnt` exceeds `numRows`.
     - For each row, a temporary vector `temp` of size `cnt` is created and initialized with 1s.
     - The previous row `last` is retrieved from `ans`.
     - If `cnt` is not 2, the inner `for` loop updates the elements of `temp` (except the first and last elements) by summing the appropriate elements from `last`.

  3. **Appending the row**:
     - The generated row `temp` is pushed into `ans`.
     - `cnt` is incremented to generate the next row.

  4. **Return**:
     - After generating all rows, the function returns `ans`.

- **Space complexity**:
  The space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows, because it stores all the elements of Pascal's Triangle.

- **Time complexity**:
  The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows, because it iterates through each element of Pascal's Triangle.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        ans.push_back({1});

        int cnt = 2;
        while (cnt <= numRows) {
            vector<int> temp(cnt, 1);
            vector<int> last = ans[cnt - 2];

            if (cnt != 2) {
                for (int i = 1; i < cnt - 1; i++) {
                    temp[i] = last[i - 1] + last[i];
                }
            }
            ans.push_back(temp);
            cnt++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
