## Explanation ##

- **Explain the logic behind the code**:
  The provided code is a C++ implementation of the "Maximum Subarray" problem, which aims to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

  1. **Initialization**:
     - `current_sum` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the sum of the current subarray.
     - `max_sum` is initialized to `INT_MIN` (the smallest possible integer). This variable keeps track of the maximum sum encountered so far.

  2. **Iteration**:
     - The code iterates through each element in the input vector `nums`.
     - For each element, it adds the element to `current_sum`.
     - It then updates `max_sum` to be the maximum of `current_sum` and `max_sum`.

  3. **Resetting `current_sum`**:
     - If `current_sum` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. This is because a negative sum would decrease the sum of any subsequent subarray, so it's better to start a new subarray.

  4. **Return**:
     - After iterating through all elements, the function returns `max_sum`, which is the largest sum of any contiguous subarray found.

- **Space complexity**:
  The space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(1)\) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

- **Time complexity**:
  The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input vector. This is because the algorithm iterates through the input vector exactly once.

-- **Suggested better solution**:
  The provided solution is already optimal in terms of time complexity. The time complexity of \(O(n)\) is the best possible for this problem. However, if the input size is very large and the input is sparse, a divide-and-conquer approach could be considered, but it would have the same \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity and higher space complexity. Therefore, the current solution is the most efficient in both time and space.
