- **Explain the logic behind the code**:
  The provided code is a C++ implementation of the "Sort Colors" problem, which aims to sort an array containing only the values 0, 1, and 2 in a single pass using the Dutch National Flag algorithm.

  1. **Initialization**:
     - `low` is initialized to 0. This variable keeps track of the position to place the next 0.
     - `mid` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to traverse the array.
     - `high` is initialized to the last index of the array. This variable keeps track of the position to place the next 2.

  2. **Iteration**:
     - The code iterates through the array using the `mid` pointer.
     - If the current element is 0, it swaps the element at `mid` with the element at `low`, then increments both `low` and `mid`.
     - If the current element is 1, it simply increments `mid`.
     - If the current element is 2, it swaps the element at `mid` with the element at `high`, then decrements `high`.

  3. **Termination**:
     - The loop continues until `mid` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all elements are sorted in a single pass.

- **Space complexity**:
  The space complexity of this algorithm is \(O(1)\) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

- **Time complexity**:
  The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the array exactly once.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& arr) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
